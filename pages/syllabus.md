### COURSE DESCRIPTION: 

 > “I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians, And I’m not kidding.”

Hal Varian, chief economist at Google


> “Without data you’re just another person with an opinion.”

W. Edwards Deming


Data and data analysis are becoming more and more important for us all
as citizens in the modern nation state, the moden work place, and as
consumers of increasingly complex information. At the same time, the
understanding of statistical fundamentals is as pertinent as ever to
read any political science research. This class serves two main
purposes. First, it will help you understand the basic statistics that
are necessary to read modern political science research. Second, you
will gain an understanding of basic methods of data analysis and the
underlying concepts of probability. We will also cover some
introductory programming, so that you will be able to write code for
basic statistical functions and plots in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of the semester, after completing this course, students are expected to:

- Understand the concept of causality and experimental designs

- Be able to do simple programming in R, such as:
  - plot and interpret histograms, scatterplots,
  - run simple statistical models in R

- Explain and understand simple descriptive, univariate, and bivariate statistical concepts, such as:
  – mean,
  – (co)variance,
  – measurement
  – Central Limit Theorem
  – bivariate linear regression
  – multivariate linear regression
  - hypothesis tests.


### COURSE STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS:

The class will meet three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. Classes will be applied, cover programming, examples, or go
over home work problems. This class will cover a variety of
(complicated) concepts. Generally concepts will first be covered in
the readings and we will go over specific applications and your
questions on these concepts in class. It is therefore important that
you do the required reading before each class period. For most weeks,
the readings & topics covered can be quite technical and challenging,
which means it is even more important that you try to understand the
material before coming to class. If you do not understand part of the
readings, it is important to raise questions in class. That is the
whole purpose of class time. I guarantee you will not be the only one
that has trouble with the material and by asking questions, you are
providing a service to your classmates. There will be regular homework
and practice assignments. The assignments are for you to deepen your
understanding of the material and study for the exam. Some of the
assignments will be quite hard. It is, however, important for your own
progress that you at least attempt to solve each problem on your own
first, before seeking help. If you are stuck, I encourage you to seek
help from your classmates, the TA, or myself.

You are expected to do all readings prior to class, participate in
class discussions, submit all assignments on time, and take exams as
scheduled.
